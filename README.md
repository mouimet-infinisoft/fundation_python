# Python Project Foundation

## Overview
This foundational base provides a standardized starting point for Python projects, whether for building applications, microservices, or as a base for more specific project templates. It's designed to offer a structured, versatile, and efficient starting point for a wide range of Python-based projects.

## Features
- **Standardized Project Structure:** Organized directories for source code (`src`) and tests (`tests`).
- **Testing Setup:** Basic unit test configuration with Python's `unittest` framework.
- **Debugging Configuration:** `.vscode/launch.json` for easy debugging in Visual Studio Code.
- **Environment Variable Management:** Setup for `.env` file for secure and efficient environment management.
- **Python Packaging Support:** Basic `setup.py` for project packaging and dependency management.
- **Gitignore Configuration:** A comprehensive `.gitignore` file to keep the repository clean.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the Python source code of your application.
- `tests/`: Directory for unit tests, with a sample test file.
- `.vscode/`: Configuration for debugging in Visual Studio Code.
- `requirements.txt`: List your Python package dependencies here.
- `.env`: Environment variables file (not tracked in version control).
- `.gitignore`: Specifies untracked files that Git should ignore.
- `README.md`: Documentation and guidelines for using this project.
- `setup.py`: Basic setup file for packaging and dependency management.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Consider using a virtual environment for package management.)

### Running the Application
- Execute your Python application from the `src` directory.

### Running the Tests
- Run the unit tests using:
  ```
  python -m unittest discover -s tests
  ```

### Debugging
- Use the configuration in `.vscode/launch.json` to debug your application in VS Code.

### Code Formatting and Linting
- (Recommendations for code formatting and linting tools can be added here.)
